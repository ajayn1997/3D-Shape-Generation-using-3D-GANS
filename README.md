# 3D-Shape-Generation-using-3D-GANS
An implementation of the paper "Learning a Probabilistic Latent Space of Object Shapes via 3D Generative-Adversial Modelling" by Wu (et al) presented at NIPS 2016. The paper introduces 3D GANs, which leverages volumetric convolutional networks and vanilla GANs to produce 3D objects from a probabilistic space. This implementations uses python and the Keras framework to build the 3D GAN Architecture.
